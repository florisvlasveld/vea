# Vea

Generate a personalized executive daily briefing, a weekly summary, a last-minute briefing for a specific calendar event, or a checklist of potentially overlooked tasks. Pulls in signals from your Google Calendar, Gmail, Todoist, local Markdown notes, and Slack – then condenses it all using AI into readable summaries.

Supported commands:

- `vea daily` – Generate a daily briefing
- `vea weekly` – Summarize your week
- `vea prepare-event` – Prepare for an upcoming meeting
- `vea check-for-tasks` – Detect untracked or unfinished to-dos based on your recent activity


## Setup

### 1. Google APIs

Download your OAuth credentials from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), and save the file as `credentials/client_secret.json`.

### 2. Authorize access (first time only)

You only need to do this once per environment.

```bash
vea auth calendar gmail
```

This will open a browser window for Google OAuth. Tokens are saved in `.credentials/`.

### 3. Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values you need:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `TODOIST_TOKEN`
- `SLACK_TOKEN`
- `BIO`
- Et cetera.

### 4. Install the tool

You can use either `pipx` or a virtual environment.

**Using pipx (recommended):**
```bash
pipx install --editable .
```

**Using a virtualenv:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```


## Daily briefing

⚠️ Note: Depending on how much data is being processed (calendar events, emails, tasks, notes, Slack messages), generating your daily brief may take several minutes or even significantly longer to complete. Some models may not be able to handle the amount of input data.

```bash
vea daily \
  --journal-dir ~/Logseq/journals \
  --extras-dir ~/Logseq/pages \
  --date 2025-05-26 \
  --save-path ~/DailyBrief/ \
  --todoist-project "My Todoist Project" \
  --calendar-blacklist "Lunch, Focus time" \
  --save-markdown
```

### Daily command options

Below is a complete list of options for `vea daily` (run `vea daily --help` to see this at any time):

- `--date` – Date to generate the brief for (defaults to today)
- `--journal-dir` – Directory with Markdown journal files (named like `YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- `--journal-days` – Number of past journal days to include (default: 21)

### Weekly summaries

You can also generate a weekly summary (a so-called “weekly heartbeat”) using:

```bash
vea weekly --week=22 --journal-dir ~/Logseq/journals --extras-dir ~/Logseq/pages --save-markdown
```

The `weekly` command supports input like `2025-W22`, `2025-22`, just `22` (current year assumed), or a date such as `2025-05-28`.

This will produce a concise, narrative-style summary of the week’s activities, based on your journal and extras entries. The output can be saved as a Markdown and/or PDF file.

### Weekly command options

Run `vea weekly --help` to see all options. Key options include:

- `--week` – Week to summarize (e.g. `2025-W22`, `2025-22`, `22`, or a date)
- `--journal-dir` – Directory containing journal files
- `--journal-days` – Number of past journal days to load for context (default: 21)
- `--extras-dir` – Directory with additional `.md` notes to include
- `--save-markdown` – Write the weekly summary to a Markdown file
- `--save-pdf` – Save the summary as a PDF
- `--save-path` – Custom output directory or file path
- `--prompt-file` – Path to a custom prompt file (default: `/prompts/weekly-default.prompt`)

### Prepare for an event

Use `vea prepare-event` to get a quick briefing before a meeting. The command collects emails, tasks, notes and Slack messages around the event time and summarizes them with your LLM of choice. By default it looks at the next calendar entry, but you can target a specific moment with the `--event` option.

```bash
vea prepare-event --lookahead-minutes 30 --slack-dm
```

Key options include:
- `--event` – Moment to prepare for. Use a start time like `2025-05-28 14:00`, `now` for the current meeting, or `next` for the next one
- `--lookahead-minutes` – How far ahead to search for the next event
- `--journal-dir` – Directory with Markdown journal files
- `--journal-days` – Number of past journal days to include (default: 21)
- `--slack-days` – Number of past days of Slack messages to load (default: 5)
- `--use-embeddings` – Retrieve only the most relevant snippets using FAISS indexes
- `--outliner-mode` – Split journal entries by top-level bullets
- `--topk-journals` – Number of journal passages to include (default: 5)
- `--topk-extras` – Number of extras passages to include (default: 5)
- `--topk-emails` – Number of email passages to include (default: 5)
- `--topk-slack` – Number of Slack passages to include (default: 5)
- `--slack-dm` – Send the output as a Slack DM to yourself

### Check for forgotten tasks

Use `vea check-for-tasks` to scan your journals, emails, Slack messages and Todoist for anything you may have missed.

```bash
vea check-for-tasks --journal-dir ~/Logseq/journals --todoist-lookback-days 10
```

This command detects untracked or unfinished to-dos based on your recent activity. Use `--todoist-lookback-days` to set how far back to include completed Todoist tasks (default: 7 days).

### AI Summary Engine

You can choose between OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), or Google Gemini models.

### Embeddings-based retrieval

Add `--use-embeddings` to `vea daily` or `vea prepare-event` to index your notes, emails and Slack messages with FAISS. Index files are stored in `~/.vea/indexes`. Journals can be split into bullet points with `--outliner-mode`. Use the `--topk-*` options to control how many passages are returned (default 5 each). Retrieved passages remain structured JSON objects so the prompts stay valid JSON.

### Vea Instructions in Today’s Journal

You can give special instructions to the LLM for the daily briefing by writing a note to `Vea` in **today’s journal entry**.

Add a bullet starting with `Vea` or `[[Vea]]` in your Markdown journal file:

```markdown
- [[Vea]] Include a short list of team birthdays this week
```

These instructions are:
- Only processed if they appear in **today’s journal file**.
- Ignored in all other journal entries.
- Treated as **binding** — the LLM will attempt to follow them, e.g.:
  - Add custom insights.
  - Emphasize specific events or people.
  - Include extra sections or summaries.

> Example use cases:
> - “Vea, remind me to be diplomatic in the meeting with John.”
> - “Vea, include a summary of the [[Monthly Report]].”

This is a powerful way to tailor your daily brief without changing any code.


## Slack Integration

To include relevant messages from Slack in your daily briefing or to send last-minute meeting briefings to your personal Slack channel, you'll need to create and install a Slack App.

### 1. Create a Slack App

Go to: [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)

- Click **"Create New App"**
- Choose **"From scratch"**
- Give it a name like `Vea`
- Select your Slack workspace

### 2. Add OAuth Scopes

Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** in the left-hand menu and under **Scopes → User Token Scopes**, add the following:

```
channels:history
channels:read
channels:write
chat:write
groups:history
groups:read
grousp:write
im:history
im:read
im:write
mpim:history
mpim:read
mpim:write
users:read
users:read.email
```

These scopes allow the app to:
- Read messages from public, private, and direct channels
- Identify users (to show who said what)
- Send last-minute meeting briefings to your personal Slack channel

> ⚠️ You may need to re-authorize the app if you change scopes later.

### 3. Install the App to your workspace

In **OAuth & Permissions**, scroll to the top and click **"Install App to Workspace"**.

This will generate a **Bot Token**, which you’ll use as `SLACK_TOKEN` in your `.env` file.

> ⚠️ Keep this token secret — it provides read access to your Slack data.

### 4. Configure your `.env` file

Add this to your `.env`:
```env
SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
```

### 5. Enable Slack loading

By default, Slack loading is enabled when you run Vea. If you want to skip it:

```bash
vea daily --include-slack False
```

Use `--slack-days` to control how many past days of Slack history are
included. The default is 5 days for the `daily` command and 3 days
for `prepare-event`.
